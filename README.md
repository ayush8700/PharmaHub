💊 PharmaHub

PharmaHub is a full-stack web application designed to modernize the pharmaceutical distribution ecosystem by directly connecting wholesalers with retailers. The platform facilitates efficient B2B transactions in the pharma space, allowing retailers to access a broad range of medicines and enabling wholesalers to expand their market reach with minimal overhead.

🎯 Problem & Motivation
The traditional pharmaceutical supply chain involves multiple intermediaries, resulting in inefficiencies, limited visibility, and restricted access for small-scale retailers. Retailers often struggle to discover better pricing or stock availability, while wholesalers lack a streamlined system to reach diverse customers.

PharmaHub aims to eliminate these barriers by offering a centralized digital marketplace that empowers retailers to source directly from multiple wholesalers. It enhances transparency, optimizes the supply chain, and encourages competition — ultimately benefiting both ends of the transaction.
